    <h1>Python Tutorial | Python Programming Language
    </h1>
    <p>Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.

      Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
      
      Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python programming.
      
      Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control statements, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Modules, Exceptions, Date and Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to help you better understand Python Programming.

    <h1>What is Python
    </h1>
    <p>Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.

      Python is an easy-to-learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.
      
      With its interpreted nature, Python's syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
      
      Python supports multiple programming patterns, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.
      
      Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. It is a multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.
      
      We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed, so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
      
      Python makes development and debugging fast because no compilation step is included in Python development, and the edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.
      
      Python has many web-based assets, open-source projects, and a vibrant community. Learning the language, working together on projects, and contributing to the Python ecosystem are all made very easy for developers.
      Because of its straightforward language framework, Python is easier to understand and write code in. This makes it a fantastic programming language for novices. Additionally, it assists seasoned programmers in writing clearer, error-free code.
      
      Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.
      
      In Python, code readability and maintainability are important. As a result, even if the code was developed by someone else, it is easy to understand and adapt by some other developer.
      
      Python has many third-party libraries that can be used to make its functionality easier. These libraries cover many domains, for example, web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.</p>

    <h1>Why learn Python?
    </h1>
    <p>Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it the most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential features of Python.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to use and Learn: </li><p>Python has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, unlike traditional languages like C, C++, Java, etc., making it easy for beginners to learn.</p>
      <li>Expressive Language:</li><p> It allows programmers to express complex concepts in just a few lines of code or reduces Developer's Time.</p>
      <li>Interpreted Language: </li><p> Python does not require compilation, allowing rapid development and testing. It uses Interpreter instead of Compiler.</p>
      <li>Object-Oriented Language:</li><p>It supports object-oriented programming, making writing reusable and modular code easy.</p>
      <li>Open Source Language:</li><p>Python is open source and free to use, distribute and modify.</p>
      <li>Extensible:</li><p>Python can be extended with modules written in C, C++, or other languages.</p>
      <li>Learn Standard Librar</li><p>Python's standard library contains many modules and functions that can be used for various tasks, such as string manipulation, web programming, and more.

    <h1>Python Exceptions
    </h1>
    <p>An exception can be defined as an unusual condition in a program resulting in an interruption in the flow of the program.

      Whenever an exception occurs, the program stops the execution, and thus the other code is not executed. Therefore, an exception is the run-time errors that are unable to handle to Python script. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.
      
      Python exceptions are an important aspect of error handling in Python programming. When a program encounters an unexpected situation or error, it may raise an exception, which can interrupt the normal flow of the program.
      
      In Python, exceptions are represented as objects containing information about the error, including its type and message. The most common type of Exception in Python is the Exception class, a base class for all other built-in exceptions.
      
      To handle exceptions in Python, we use the try and except statements. The try statement is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception, while the except statement is used to define a block of code that should be executed when an exception occurs.
